 ### The Stable Matching Game
 On the [previous](@previous), we learned what makes a matching **stable**. Now it's time to test your knowledge and try to find one!
 
 Run this *Page* and start the *Live View* to start the game.
 
 You can create a match by tapping a human and then an animal.
 After you've matched everyone, you will see if you were successful!
 
 Good luck üçÄ
